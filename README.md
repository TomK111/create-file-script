# Create File Shell Script

This is a bash shell script that will create a file and enable executable permissions depending on the extension. 

If the file name already exists within the directory, a message will be provided stating so.

If the file name doesn't exist, the script will create the file.

If the extension of the file ends in `.sh`, executable permissions to the user will be enabled.
